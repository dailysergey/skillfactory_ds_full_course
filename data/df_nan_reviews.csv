Great managed restaurant!', ""I was staying at the Arcotel Denauzentrum on a business trip. This restaurant was very convenient to my hotel and the perfect choice for an evening when I just wanted something quick to eat. I walked over and ordered at the counter. my sushi was...ready in about 5-10 minutes while I waited. The sushi was excellent. I can't comment on the restaurant dining experience since I did take out but the space looked inviting.More"", 'This happens when one does not habe any idea of basic crisis management and no orientation in simple food quality.\n\nWe have been visiting this place repeatedly, about once every 4-6 weeks for years. But today was our last time. We even don\'t order food...to get delivered from Akakiko any more.\n\nMy son 7 years old, ordered his beloved salmon sushi. When he started to take the salmon off the rice (after he had eaten one small bite of it) and pile it up in one corner of his plate, I became suspicious. When I asked him why he was doing this, his answer was ""daddy, it is smoked, and I don\'t like it.""\n\nSo I tried one bite. Instead of smoked, the fish was entirely tasteless, way too fat PLUS had this earthy taste of a fish which is simply not fresh or comes from one of the cheapest sources of fish that you can find. Either way, this salmon was uneatable. When I tried, I had to spit it out immediately and felt nothing but disgust. I still do, as I write this.\n\nThe waiter, who I informed about the case only took the plate away. No excuse. And just as expected ( I would have won every bet) , this plate was OF COURSE on the check. \nThe other waiter who presented the check was not informed about our complaint either.\n\nThen they called the owner of the establishment. And guess what. He informed me that the salmon was perfectly okay and that ""I dad a problem with the fish"". His approach towards me is hard to describe. Ignorant, hostile and arrogant.\n\nThat\'s what I call a perfect crisis management. The client has a problem, not the establishment. I usually hardly complain, but a dish not eatable is quite a reason to say something. Isn\'t it? Instead of taking the chance to improve, they handle everything to their own and to the client\'s worst.\n\nNow, the most interesting part: They brought the same slamon from the kitchen as a proof, but the owner would not try the fish. Because he already knew about this ""superior"" salmon? Because he reportedly already ate it and found it perfect? I assume, he has neither an idea of crisis management nor does he have tastebuds. \n\nAnd even less, he has any idea about how to run a business which should last longer than a week.\n\nHe is a good salesperson, though. Because he sold us, his customers, for EUR8,50. Since this is what we usually give for tips, he could have easily afforded to take this horrible, rotten salmon off the check and out of the kitchen.\n\nNEVER AGAIN.

I had to ask for a baby seat 3 times and they only got it after I went there to get it myself. After that we had the same problem with ordering our drinks (I had to ask 3 times to 2 waiters before someone actually brought the coke which they forgot in the initial order). So there are 3 waiters walking around going in and out the kitchen all the time, looking really chaotic, while the actual visitors of the restaurant are practically ignored, I wonder what they were doing. I urge the manager to review the older lady at the restaurant, she was not pleasant to deal with and ignored us after some complaints. The other staff was much more pleasant to deal with.\n\nThe 25 euro beef was overcooked (medium / well done instead of medium rare) and the chocolate cake with our desert was undercooked (microwaved in a rush). Other than that the food was pretty tasty (maybe too much salt), however the presentation and portion size was not aquedate.More', 'The breakfast is a typical hotel buffet and the staff are helpful. There is a lot of fruit and pastries, eggs etc, it does not change from day to day and the croissants varied from quite to over cooked. Dinner however was much better, the...service is good and the food very good with a decent selection of reasonably priced wines.More', '.\nWe were staying at the Hotel Holiday Inn – Lisboa and we decided to have dinner in the hotel’s restaurant as we had tickets to the Theatre and we had to arrive strictly on time. And it was a very nice surprise! \n. \nOn...the first night we had the Chef’s Menu of the day, which included a crab soup, a chicken entrée and a chocolate dessert. The broth of the soup was clear and bright and the crab ravioli superb; the chicken breast was well cooked but juicy and the sauce joined together the baby vegetables and the chicken; the chocolate cake had a number of thin layers, was very smooth and accompanied by a basil sorbet quite fresh and nice to finish the meal… \n. \nOn the second night the dinner was ‘a la carte’ only and we had two meat dishes: a nice medium/rare stake with vegetables and a small amount of fries, and a nice and tasty small pork stakes with baby vegetables. As dessert we tried a cheese cake of red fruits and an apple pie with vanilla sorbet. \n. \nAs far as wine is concerned, we had two standard wines of the restaurant –‘vinho da casa’–, the ‘Terras do Crato Branco’ from ‘Alentejo’ on the first night and the ‘Pérola Branco’ from ‘Douro’ on the second night. As the first one was a little bit too citric for us we did prefer the second one that was softer on the mouth. \n. \nThe staff was friendly and attentive. \n. \nTwo nights and two great dinners that were beyond our expectations! \n.More'], ['December 7, 2019', 'October 1, 2019', 'July 23, 2019']]"

We got (and were charged) a second half liter expensive wine we did not order. So when we received the bill charging 120€ our coupon was ignored.

The restaurant is situated on Calle Conde Duque and has...an unpretentious exterior but is very cozy and warm inside (We were in Madrid during 5 days of chilly spring rain). The staff welcomed us like old friends and Chef Oswaldo Sanchez arrived promptly to see what he could tempt us with for dinner. We’d had a large lunch earlier in the day as we were attending family gatherings, so we chose lighter options. \nOn this occasion my partner had salmon on a bed of smokey tomato sauce. I had the squid done to perfection and the best squid I’ve ever tasted. It was juicy and seasoned very delicately. The fish dishes were enhanced by the crusty patatas braves along with delicious pine nut salad. My partner also ate his salmon with enthusiasm and relish.\nAfter conversing among ourselves, amid other contented Spanish diners, Chef Sanchez came over and talked with us, about what deserts we might want. He clearly enjoys his work. He told us how the food was prepared and about his approach to his cuisine, which we decided is Latin American fusion, although, in truth his ingenuity stretches across the Mediterranean as well!\nWe finished the meal with three desserts which we shared as each was so different.\nWe\xa0\xa0had the Tarta Tres Leches, (three milk pudding) gently flavoured to taste almost like ice cream with hints of vanilla, sugar and spice; the Delicia De Chocolate, was firm enough to hold together as a cake but was soft and crumbly in the mouth with a modest taste of sweet apple with cinnamon and a favourite for us was the upside down lemon tart, Pie De Limón Inverso. It defied the usual chef’s habit of over-sweetening the lemon and left a fresh tang of citrus, blended with meringue, in the mouth.\nThis was the perfect accompaniment to the aguardiente with which we finished our selection of wines.\nI will not comment on the surprising loo as it would spoil the fun, but, it too, reveals the generous graciousness of our host.

The place looks great and has lots of charm, the seating is comfortable...and they don\'t try and pack too many people in.  We joined friends who had already almost finished their meal, but still we ordered our drinks and then after a bit order some food.  The menu isn\'t super large for brunch so you may end up picking something that might not be 100% what you like.  So we did enjoy ourselves, but waited and waited for drinks and food.. A couple more people joined our table, ordered food and drinks.  Still over 1/2 hr and no drinks have yet arrived, others have gotten service, table behind us had gotten their drinks and food before we even gotten drinks.  One waiter finally noticed and asked us, we told him we had nothing.  He said he would sort it out, another 15 mins a still nothing.  Finally we served ourself some water from the side service table.  The waiter and over and said the computers crashed and confirmed our order, over an hour now just to get an apfel schoale and ice tea.  We started talking about this and the table behind us had shown up, ordered, eaten and paid by the time we only got drinks.  We decided we would just cancel and go elsewhere at this point. We were beyond ""hangry"" at this point.

The food was cold, most of it should be but poached eggs should be slightly warm from cooking, however these were full cold, they have been sitting around.  The food was Ok, not really special for the pricing and came with one little slice of bread.  At this point the waiter really tried to be nice, offered to not have to pay for the late drinks, and then sent over a croissant and bun with spread.

We arrived at around 19:00 to find a quite busy assembly of wooden huts, trampoline, hammocks, raised platforms and a tower. The bar inside had a generous selection of draught and bottled beers. The menu showed imported and local craft beers on opposite sides of the sheet so useful. The prices were very reasonable starting from 490 for a half litre although some Belgian 330cl were 1090 or a Scottish Jackhammer for 1190. I stuck to a Hungarian half litre of dark Fekete at 690 and my friend a wheat Silver Street also at 690. I did not realise mine was 7.2% as not marked on the menu (a 9.5% Dead Rabbit .33l was marked though!).\n\nWe took the beers to the spare table on the raised platform by the tower to enjoy the river and Magrit Island Watertower view and relative peace.

The great service was the icing on the cake that distinguished good restaurants from the...great ones. I had the 3 course carte blanche dinner menu at €33, and it was simply divine. \n\nWe were first served with a complimentary amuse bouché, a petit portion of cream of onion with crispy onions on top. Perfectly balanced dish to whet my appetite, and it set my expectations rather high for what was to come. \n\nStarter (first course): seared foie gras served on a bed of celery risotto. Completely exceeded all expectations set by the amuse bouché. Let me make this clear - I don't like celery. In fact, I dislike it so much that you would have to force me to eat it (on hindsight, it was partially my fault they even served me celery cause the service staff did ask me if there was anything i didn't eat and I responded that there was none). That said, I completely cleaned out my plate. The foie gras was perfect - crispy on the outside and soft and lusciously creamy on the inside. The celery and herbs counterbalanced the richness of the foie gras with their freshness.\n\nMain (second course): duck breast (canard) served with onions 3 ways and a carrot puree. This dish was just so much fun to eat. Perfectly cooked breast meat seared on the skin was tender and juicy, matched perfectly with the sweetness of carrot puree and roasted onions. The burnt onions add another dimension of flavour and fragrance, while the pickled onions refresh your palate when the going gets too heavy. A true, heavenly gastronomic experience. \n\nDessert (third course): rhubarb, rhubarb sorbet and crumbled tart served with strawberries and thyme infused cream/mousse. The sweetness of the crumbled tart, strawberries and thyme infused cream/mousse is cut by the intense tartness of the rhubarb and rhubarb sorbet. The different textures and unevenness of the tart crumble gives each bite a different experience and just keeps you going back for more. A perfect way to end a rich meal.\n\nOverall, cozy restaurant, food from the soul, honest prices, amazing experience. I would travel to eat here again.More"", 'It was truly scrumptious!
